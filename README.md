## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Lu JingFeng.

## :panda_face: About me

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student deeply passionate about LC-MS/MS, metabolomics, and proteomics. My research centers on the integration of experimental workflows and computational pipelines to decode complex biological systems using mass spectrometry-based omics data.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on applying advanced data analysis methods to large-scale metabolomics and proteomics datasets to uncover biological insights, discover potential biomarkers, and support systems biology research.

## ðŸ’» Tools & skills I frequently use:

 - R / Python for data analysis & visualization
 - Shiny for building interactive apps
 - MZmine, SIRIUS, and other MS tools
 - Git, LaTeX, and workflow automation tools
