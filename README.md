## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Lu JingFeng.

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student deeply passionate about LC-MS/MS, metabolomics, and proteomics. My research centers on the integration of experimental workflows and computational pipelines to decode complex biological systems using mass spectrometry-based omics data.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on applying advanced data analysis methods to large-scale metabolomics and proteomics datasets to uncover biological insights, discover potential biomarkers, and support systems biology research.

ðŸ§ª Current research interests:
	â€¢	Mass spectrometry data preprocessing and interpretation
	â€¢	Integration of metabolomics and proteomics (multi-omics)
	â€¢	Computational biomarker discovery
	â€¢	Visualization and reproducibility in omics data analysis

ðŸ’» Tools & skills I frequently use:
	â€¢	R / Python for data analysis & visualization
	â€¢	Shiny for building interactive apps
	â€¢	MZmine, SIRIUS, and other MS tools
	â€¢	Git, LaTeX, and workflow automation tools

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, learning new technologies, and contributing to open science projects. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out!
